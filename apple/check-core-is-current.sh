# Fail the build if the app is about to link a core older than the core sources.
#
# The framework is a prebuilt dependency, produced by
# apple/build-core-xcframework.sh. It cannot be produced during the build:
# ProcessXCFramework, the task that extracts the library the app links, plans
# its inputs before any phase runs, so a framework rebuilt mid-build is picked
# up only by the next one — silently, which is the whole danger. This makes the
# staleness loud instead.
#
# The comparison is by content digest rather than by modification time, because
# switching branches rewinds timestamps and would make a stale core look fresh.
